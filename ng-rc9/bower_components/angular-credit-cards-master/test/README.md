## Testing angular-credit-cards

The test suite can be run with `npm test` after cloning the repository and running `npm install`. angular-credit-cards tests the functionality and features of its directives, their interactions, and the various attributes they can receive. For test coverage of parsing and formatting of card data, see:

* The [creditcards test suite](https://github.com/bendrucker/creditcards/tree/master/test), which provides more than 30 tests against card data parsing and validation logic
* The [creditcards-types test suite](https://github.com/bendrucker/creditcards-types/blob/master/test), which provides nearly 70 additional tests against card type matching functionality
