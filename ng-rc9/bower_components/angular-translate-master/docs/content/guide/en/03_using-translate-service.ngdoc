# Using $translate service

`angular-translate` provides several ways to translate the contents of your app.
One way is to use the provided `$translate` service directly. You actually
wouldn't use this approach, because you don't want to bind your apps
controllers and services too hard to your translated content. However it turned
out that there are indeed cases where you need to translate contents with
`$translate` service.

Just imagine the case, where you want to translate the content of your HTML
documents `<title>` tag. The `<title>` will never ever be inside of your `ng-app`
directive, which means it is always outside of an Angular world. So, to achieve
this, you actually have to manipulate your apps title once your app is running
through controller or service logic.

## General usage
This is where `$translate` service comes in. Using `$translate` service is very
easy. First of all, you have to inject it per dependency injection (like every
service you want to use within your Angular code). Let's say we want to extend
the app we started building in [Getting Started](#/guide/02_getting-started).

Our code would look something like this:

<pre>
app.controller('Ctrl', ['$translate', function ($translate) {

}]);
</pre>

Now to translate your contents with `$translate` service, all you have to do is
to pass a translation ID which was registered with `$translateProvider` before.
Since it could be that there's some asynchronous loading going on (we'll get into
this later), `$translate` service behaves asynchronous too and returns a promise,
that either gets resolved with the translatoin of the given translation ID, or
rejected with the translation ID. So the basic usage of `$translate` service
on a controller (or service) level, would look like this:

<pre>
app.controller('Ctrl', ['$scope', '$translate', function ($scope, $translate) {
  $translate('HEADLINE').then(function (headline) {
    $scope.headline = headline;
  });
  $translate('PARAGRAPH').then(function (paragraph) {
    $scope.paragraph = paragraph;
  });
  $translate('NAMESPACE.PARAGRAPH').then(function (anotherOne) {
    $scope.namespaced_paragraph = anotherOne;
  });
}]);
</pre>

**Note:** Namespaced translations are accessed as JSON properties, see 'NAMESPACE.PARAGRAPH'`.

That's all. Now when you think about translating the contents of a `<title>` you
can do so within your controller.

## Multiple translation IDs
The translation service is also aware of requesting multiple translation at once.

<pre>
app.controller('Ctrl', ['$scope', '$translate', function ($scope, $translate) {
  $translate(['HEADLINE', 'PARAGRAPH', 'NAMESPACE.PARAGRAPH']).then(function (translations) {
    $scope.headline = translations.HEADLINE;
    $scope.paragraph = translations.PARAGRAPH;
    $scope.namespaced_paragraph = translations['NAMESPACE.PARAGRAPH'];
  });
}]);
</pre>

However, the service will always return an object containing translations -- regardless whether
a translation (or even all of them) has failed. When requesting multiple translations
in one request, it is up to you to deal with the result.

## angular-translate library version information
As it may be useful for some "About" information in your application, we provide you a convenience
function to display or use the installed library version information.

Just call it this way:
<pre>
  $translate.versionInfo();
  // returns e.g. "2.1.0"
</pre>

## Things to keep in mind
Please keep in mind that the usage of the `$translate` service doesn't provide a two-way
data binding default! `$translate` service works asynchronously, which means
it returns the translation for the given translation id, as soon as it could determine
it. If it doesn't exist it'll probably just return the translation id.

However, this doesn't mean that it knows when a languages has been changed. And because
of that, translations translated through a directive `$translate` call, don't get
updated when changing the language at runtime.

You can fix that by simply wrapping your `$translate` call into a `$translateChangeSuccess`
callback on `$rootScope`, which gets fired every time a translation change was successful.
Once it's changed, you can simply re-execute the code, that gives you your needed translations.

Here's how it could look like:

<pre>
app.controller('Ctrl', ['$scope', '$translate', '$rootScope', function ($scope, $translate, $rootScope) {
  $rootScope.$on('$translateChangeSuccess', function () {
    $translate('HEADLINE').then(function (translation) {
      $scope.headline = translation;
    });
  });
}]);
</pre>

Why on `$rootScope` instead of just `$scope` you wonder? angular-translate only `$emit`'s on
`$rootScope` level because of performance reasons.

Here's a working sample:

<doc:example module="myApp">
  <doc:source>
    <script>
      var translations = {
        HEADLINE: 'What an awesome module!',
        PARAGRAPH: 'Srsly!',
        NAMESPACE: {
          PARAGRAPH: 'And it comes with awesome features!'
        }
      };

      var app = angular.module('myApp', ['pascalprecht.translate']);

      app.config(['$translateProvider', function ($translateProvider) {
        // add translation table
        $translateProvider
          .translations('en', translations)
          .preferredLanguage('en');
      }]);

      app.controller('Ctrl', ['$scope', '$translate', function ($scope, $translate) {
        // expose translation via `$translate` service
        $translate('HEADLINE').then(function (headline) {
          $scope.headline = headline;
        });
        $translate('PARAGRAPH').then(function (paragraph) {
          $scope.paragraph = paragraph;
        });
        $translate('NAMESPACE.PARAGRAPH').then(function (anotherOne) {
          $scope.namespaced_paragraph = anotherOne;
        });
      }]);
    </script>
    <div ng-controller="Ctrl">
      <h1>{{headline}}</h1>
      <p>{{paragraph}}</p>
      <p>{{namespaced_paragraph}}</p>
    </div>
  </doc:source>
</doc:example>
