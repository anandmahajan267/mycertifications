# Asynchronous Loading

Okay, different translations for different languages is pretty cool. But it's
even better if you're able to load translations asynchronously right?
`angular-translate` has some pretty cool extensions to support asynchronous and
lazy loading of translation data. And it works like a charm.

## Asynchronous loaders
angular-translate provides a pretty clever way to tell $translate service to
load data asynchronously. To load your data from a server you have to use an
asynchronous loader, which gets invoked later at runtime when it's needed.
angular-translate comes with support for three different asynchronous loaders. All
of them are installable via Bower. Let's take a look at them!

## Using urlLoader
This is possibly the simplest way of loading translation data asynchronously.
All you have to do, is to install the `angular-translate-loader-url` extension
via Bower like this:

```
$ bower install angular-translate-loader-url
```

Once it's installed, make sure you've embeded it in your HTML document. Alright,
the loader is available, we now have to tell angular-translate to use it.
`$translateProvider` provides a method called `useUrlLoader()`. Pretty straight
forward, ha? `useUrlLoader()` expects an argument that describes the endpoint
of a server that'll respond with translation data.

In addition, when using asynchronous loaders, we have to use
`$translateProvider.preferredLanguage()`, to let angular-translate know for which
language it should load the translation data.

<pre>
$translateProvider.useUrlLoader('foo/bar.json');
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
</pre>

So, what happens here? angular-translate uses the extension to transform the
given string, to a real loader function which can be invoked later at runtime,
once `$translate` service is instantiated. In addition to that, telling
angular-translate to use the language key 'en', adds the language key as request
parameter to the given loader string.

So, the example above actually requests `foo/bar.json?lang=en`. angular-translate
also notices that there isn't any translation data available at startup and will
invoke the loader automatically as soon as possible.

## Using staticFilesLoader

In case you haven't got just a URL which expects a `lang` parameter to return a JSON
that contains your translations, but several localization files which match a
specific pattern, you probably want to use the
`angular-translate-loader-static-files` extension which describes the pattern of
your localization files.

Like urlLoader, you can install staticFilesLoader extension via Bower:
```
$ bower install angular-translate-loader-static-files
```

Once the package is installed and embedded, you can use `$translateProvider`
method `useStaticFilesLoader()` to tell angular-translate that it should use it.
The static files loader works a bit differently. Instead of having a fixed url which
just expects a `lang` parameter, you are now able to have different localization
files that match a specific pattern.

How that kind of pattern looks like depends on your needs. To specify a pattern,
the following information is required:

* **prefix** - specifies file prefix
* **suffix** - specifies file suffix

Let's say you have two localization files `locale-de.json` and  `locale-en.json`.
You can simply use the loader like this:

<pre>
$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
    prefix: 'locale-',
    suffix: '.json'
});
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
</pre>

Alternatively, if you have multiple translation files in distinct locations, you
may instead supply an array of files to the loader:

<pre>
$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
    files: [{
        prefix: 'locale-',
        suffix: '.json'
    }, {
        prefix: '/absolute/path/to/locale-',
        suffix: '.json'
    }, {
        prefix: 'another/path/to/locales/',
        suffix: ''
    }]
});
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
</pre>

angular-translate will concatenate the given information to
`{{prefix}}{{langKey}}{{suffix}}`. So this will load `locale-en.json`. And again,
since there isn't any translation data available yet, it'll load it as soon as
possible automatically.

## Using partialLoader
When having a bigger complex app, you usually break your app down in several
submodules. For example, you could have a module `mainApp` which depends on
something like a `home` and a `contact` module. These are just two submodules but
now imagine you have a really big app that depends on 10 or 20 submodules!

In such apps maybe 13 of the 20 submodules never get executed because the user
just don't get there. However, when translating contents of such a big app where
maybe about 50% of the app is not always executed, it's not very cool to load
all the translation data for the whole app, just in a different language.

What we need, is a way to just load the translation data of a language for a specific
module we're currently on. Which means, when accessing the `home` submodule,
we just want to load the translation data for the `home` module. If we change the
language, we also just want to load the translation for the chosen language for
the `home` module.

In addition, when we've already loaded translation data for let's say three
different modules, and change the language and then change the language again
to the language we already had, we don't want to load the data again, because
we already loaded it a little while ago.

Yea, these are all the things we have to care about when we wanna have partial
loading. However, `angular-translate` got your covered. This is where
`partialLoader` comes in.

You can install it like every other loader by simply using Bower:

```
$ bower install angular-translate-loader-partial
```

When using `partialLoader` you have to think about which pattern
`angular-translate` should use to load your translation data. It's similar to
`staticFilesLoader` but a bit more specifc. You have to specify a `part` and
a `lang` property, where `part` is your specifc part of your app (maybe `home`)
and `lang` is the lang key just as you know.

Let's say we've structured our translation files by module and the files look
like this:

```
/i18n/home/en.json
/i18n/home/de.json
/i18n/contact/en.json
/i18n/contact/de.json
```

Pretty straight forward ha? Now that we know how our data is structured, we
can configure `$translateProvider` to use the partial loader with this pattern:

<pre>
$translateProvider.useLoader('$translatePartialLoader', {
  urlTemplate: '/i18n/{part}/{lang}.json'
});
</pre>

Almost done! Of course `angular-translate` has to know which language to use, which
is why we add the following:

<pre>
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
</pre>

Okay, nothing new. Now it gets interesting. How does `angular-translate` know
which "part" to load? To make it short: it can't. You have to tell
`angular-translate` **which part** you want to load **when**.

`partialLoader` comes with a `provider` you can use to configure the inital
state of the loader. So, to use this provider we have to inject it into our
config function:

<pre>
angular.module('main')
.config(function ($translateProvider, $translatePartialLoaderProvider) {

});
</pre>

Allright. Now, to let `angular-translate` know which part it should load,
we use `$translatePartialLoaderProvider`'s `addPart()` method. So we simply
say something like:

<pre>
$translatePartialLoaderProvider.addPart('home');
$translateProvider.useLoader('$translatePartialLoader', {
  urlTemplate: '/i18n/{part}/{lang}.json'
});
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
</pre>

As you can see, the whole functionality for partial loader sits in the provided
loader, rather then `angular-translate` itself. The pattern is now complete and
`angular-translate` will execute the loader as soon as possible.

Okay, so this is the inital process but what about runtime? What if a user comes
accross the `contact` module and we only want to load the translation data for
the current language for the `contact` module?

`$translatePartialLoaderProvider` configures `$translatePartialLoader` which means
you're able to inject `$translatePartialLoader` into your controllers and services
to make use of it. But why do you want to? As you can add a translation part to
the loader via the provider, you can also do so with the provided service to
manipulate loader state at runtime. So what does that mean? It means, you just
have to inject the loader and use that one to add additional translation parts.

Let's say we have a `ContactCtrl` within our `contact` module, things could look
like this:

<pre>
angular.module('contact')
.controller('ContactCtrl', function ($scope, $translatePartialLoader) {
  $translatePartialLoader.addPart('contact');
});
</pre>

That wasn't hard, right? So what happens here is we manipulate our loaders state
during runtime. This makes sure that angular-translate only loads specific
translation data when we really want to. Once you added a new part,
`$translatePartialLoader` fires an `$translatePartialLoaderStructureChanged`
event.

Until now there's no additional data loaded! `angular-translate` doesn't know
about the loaders state so you have to tell `angular-translate` to **refresh**
the current translation tables. Refreshing translation tables drops
(if no table is specified) and reloads them. So basically, to achieve partial
loading, all you have to do is to manipulate the state of the loader by saying
which parts to add and then refreshing the tables. Because, when changing the
loaders state with new parts, they get loaded the next time the loader gets
invoked.

So all we have to do is simply adding the following:

<pre>
angular.module('contact')
.controller('ContactCtrl', function ($scope, $translatePartialLoader, $translate) {
  $translatePartialLoader.addPart('contact');
  $translate.refresh();
});
</pre>

You can also use the `$translatePartialLoaderStructureChanged` event to automate
the process, by listening to that event with `$rootScope` and refreshing
translation tables everytime it gets fired.

<pre>
app.run(function ($rootScope, $translate) {
  $rootScope.$on('$translatePartialLoaderStructureChanged', function () {
    $translate.refresh();
  });
});
</pre>

Since `$translate.refresh()` returns a promise, it works beautifully together
with either `ngRoute` module or UI Router.

An interesting question is how to deal with loading errors. By default the partial
loader rejects a whole loading process if any of the parts was not loaded from the
server. But you can change this behavior a bit. The loader provides an ability to
specify an error handler - a service which will be called if some part can not be
loaded. In this service you are able to do anything to handle such situations.

There are a few things you have to know before you'll be able to create your first
error handler:

1) The partial loader expects the error handler to have the following signature
`function (part:String, langKey:String):Promise`
2) You have to either resolve the promise with a translation table for the given
part and language or reject it
3) The partial loader will use the given translation table like it was successfully
fetched from the server
4) If you reject the promise, then the loader will reject the whole loading process

Here is an example of a simple error handler:

```js
angular.module('translation')
.factory('MyErrorHandler', function ($q, $log) {
  return function (part, lang) {
    $log.error('The "' + part + '/' + lang + '" part was not loaded.');
    return $q.when({});
  };
});
```

So, now all we have to do is to tell the partial loader which service it has to
use as an error handler:

<pre>
$translateProvider.useLoader('$translatePartialLoader', {
  urlTemplate: '/i18n/{part}/{lang}.json',
  loadFailureHandler: 'MyErrorHandler'
});
</pre>

## Lazy loading at runtime

Once your app bootstraps, it'll load needed translation data asynchronously as
soon as possible. Okay, cool. But what if a user wants to change the language and
the corresponding translation data isn't also loaded yet?

In [Multi Language](#/guide/07_multi-language) you've learned, how to change the
language at runtime using `$translate.use()`. Know what? Nothing will change when
dealing with asynchronous loaders. `$translate.use()` checks if a translation
table for a given language key is present or not. And if not, it'll invoke the
registered loader to get it down! Lazy loading at it best!

**Note**: Please notice that in case of using `partialLoader` you have to refresh
translation tables first!

## Configuration of a loader

Each loader can be applied a dedicated configuration `options`, both for the common constructor
`useLoader()` and `useStaticFilesLoader(options)`:

<pre>
$translateProvider.useLoader('customLoader', {
  settingA: 'foobar'
});
$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
  $http: {
    method: 'POST'
  }
});
</pre>

The property `$http` will be used internally in the loaders, except attribute `cache` could be
overridden (see next chapter)).

## Using a cache

In order to control the caching behavior of the existing loaders, you can use an
cache instance. See more details about this at the
[Official AngularJS Docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$cacheFactory.Cache).

In order to enable a standard cache, you can use following shortcut:

<pre>
$translateProvider.useLoaderCache(true); // default is false which means disable
</pre>

If you have already an instance (i.e. advanced configuration), you can bind this:

<pre>
$translateProvider.useLoaderCache(yourSpecialCacheService);
</pre>

Angular-Translate also supports lazy binding for instances, so this will work, too:

<pre>
$translateProvider.useLoaderCache('yourSpecialCacheService');
</pre>

The instance named with ID `yourspecialCacheService` will be looked up on demand.

## FOUC - Flash of untranslated content

There's one drawback when using asynchronous loaders to get your translation data
into the app. There's a little amount of time when your app launches where you
have this little kind of flickering, because your translation data isn't loaded
yet. This is actually not a bug of angular-translate, but a pretty logical behavior
since we return executing stuff asynchronously.

To get around this, you could provide at least one language **with** your app
without having to load it asynchronously. If your app then uses this provided
language as default language, using `$translateProvider.preferredLanguage()`, you
won't have this FOUC, because the language to use is already there.

Just use a combination of `$translateProvider.translations()` and
`$translateProvider.{{whatever}}Loader` like this:

<pre>
$translateProvider.translations('en', {
    'HELLO_TEXT': 'Hello World!'
});
$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
    'prefix': 'locale-',
    'suffix': '.json'
});
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
</pre>

**Note:** An Angular Translate user has been posted a nice solution [using Grunt](https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate/issues/921).
Another user has published a solution [using Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-ng-lang2js).

Let's update our sample app accordingly to use an asynchronous loader! We'll use
the staticFilesLoader. First, we have to pull the translation tables out of the
code and put them into separate locale files:

**Note:** The data is now provided as _JSON_ so make sure to put everything in
double quotes! Also make sure to NOT copy the comment and let your server send
JSON as JSON not as plain text!

<pre>
// locale-en.json
{
  "HEADLINE": "What an awesome module!",
  "PARAGRAPH": "Srsly!",
  "PASSED_AS_TEXT": "Hey there! I'm passed as text value!",
  "PASSED_AS_ATTRIBUTE": "I'm passed as attribute value, cool ha?",
  "PASSED_AS_INTERPOLATION": "Beginners! I'm interpolated!",
  "VARIABLE_REPLACEMENT": "Hi {{name}}",
  "BUTTON_LANG_DE": "German",
  "BUTTON_LANG_EN": "English"
}
</pre>

<pre>
// locale-de.json
{
  "HEADLINE": "Was für ein großartiges Modul!",
  "PARAGRAPH": "Ernsthaft!",
  "PASSED_AS_TEXT": "Hey! Ich wurde als text übergeben!",
  "PASSED_AS_ATTRIBUTE": "Ich wurde als Attribut übergeben, cool oder?",
  "PASSED_AS_INTERPOLATION": "Anfänger! Ich bin interpoliert!",
  "VARIABLE_REPLACEMENT": "Hi {{name}}",
  "BUTTON_LANG_DE": "deutsch",
  "BUTTON_LANG_EN": "englisch"
}
</pre>

Next we setup `$translate` service using `$translateProvider`:

<pre>
// configures staticFilesLoader
$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
  prefix: 'data/locale-',
  suffix: '.json'
});
// load 'en' table on startup
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
</pre>

## Force asynchronous reloading

When using a combination of `$translateProvider.translations()` and
`$translateProvider.{{whatever}}Loader`, for each language keys declared
using `$translateProvider.translations()`, the asynchronous loader will
not be called.

To get around this, you can enable the `$translateProvider.forceAsyncReload()`
like this:

<pre>
$translateProvider.translations('en', {
    'HELLO_TEXT': 'Hello World!'
});
$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
    'prefix': 'locale-',
    'suffix': '.json'
});
$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
$translateProvider.forceAsyncReload(true);
</pre>

This way, even if the language key is already declared using
`$translateProvider.translations()` the asynchronous loader will be called
and translations from both sources will be merged.

**Note:** If a same translation id is declared in both sources, the translation
from the asynchronous loader will be used.

Since we don't have to make any changes in our controllers or HTML, we are done!
Take a look at the working app:

<doc:example module="myApp">
  <doc:source>
    <script>
      var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngCookies', 'pascalprecht.translate']);

      app.config(['$translateProvider', function ($translateProvider) {
        $translateProvider.translations('en', {
          "HEADLINE": "What an awesome module!",
          "PARAGRAPH": "Srsly!",
          "PASSED_AS_TEXT": "Hey there! I'm passed as text value!",
          "PASSED_AS_ATTRIBUTE": "I'm passed as attribute value, cool ha?",
          "PASSED_AS_INTERPOLATION": "Beginners! I'm interpolated!",
          "VARIABLE_REPLACEMENT": "Hi {{name}}",
          "BUTTON_LANG_DE": "German",
          "BUTTON_LANG_EN": "English"
        });
        // configures staticFilesLoader
        $translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({
          prefix: 'data/locale-',
          suffix: '.json'
        });
        // load 'en' table on startup
        $translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');
      }]);

      app.controller('Ctrl', ['$translate', '$scope', function ($translate, $scope) {

        $scope.changeLanguage = function (langKey) {
          $translate.use(langKey);
        };
      }]);
    </script>
    <div ng-controller="Ctrl">
      <p>{{ 'HEADLINE' | translate }}</p>
      <p>{{ 'PARAGRAPH' | translate }}</p>

      <p translate>PASSED_AS_TEXT</p>
      <p translate="PASSED_AS_ATTRIBUTE"></p>
      <p translate>{{ 'PASSED_AS_INTERPOLATION' }}</p>
      <p translate="{{ 'PASSED_AS_INTERPOLATION' }}"></p>
      <p translate="VARIABLE_REPLACEMENT" translate-values="{ name: 'PascalPrecht' }"></p>

      <button ng-click="changeLanguage('de')" translate="BUTTON_LANG_DE"></button>
      <button ng-click="changeLanguage('en')" translate="BUTTON_LANG_EN"></button>
    </div>
  </doc:source>
</doc:example>

Open up your browser's devtools and take a look at the network activities when changing
the language. Our app now loads translation data asynchronously! In the next
chapter you'll learn how to build **your own custom loaders**.
