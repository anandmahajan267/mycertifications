      <p>Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Singapore, RC9 (formerly RENTCARS) is focused on being the leading personal transportation for everyone in the ASEAN Region. RC9 connects people through great vehicle sharing and rental experiences. RC9 strongly believes in a successful vehicle sharing economy where transportation is made transparent.</p>
      <p>In partnership with iBosses Corporation (ASX:IB8), RC9 is growing its digital platforms across Asia and is continuously working to capitalize on rapidly growing sharing economy. With the continuous growth of vehicle rental companies hosting vehicles on RC9, we are constantly improving on trust and safety measures for both the host and renters.</p>
